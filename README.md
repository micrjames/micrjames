- 👋 Hi, There!
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, coding, puzzles, mathematics, and any combinations of those things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React as well as Next. I've started dabbling in Golang as well. It's an interesting language with some similarities to C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. I'd like to learn more about the things that I've come across on my journey and a new and exciting should help me do just that.
